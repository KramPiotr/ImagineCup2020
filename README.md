  <p align="center">Our Imagine Cup 2020 project is built on top of NestJS. A progressive <a href="http://nodejs.org" target="blank">Node.js</a> framework for building efficient and scalable server-side applications.
  
#####Unfortunately we didn't finish integration of frontend and backend of our project before the deadline 
####as we thought that we will be able to continue working on it until the finals.
####If you select our project we will fix it before that. Backend works great already, just the integration part with frontend and testing is missing.

## Frontend instructions
Install react native, yarn and launch an android emulator 
```bash
$ cd frontend/react-native-app
$ yarn install
$ react-native run-android
```


## Installation

Install all the necessary packages using npm:

```bash
$ npm install
```

To Configure Redis and PostGres SQL Database, use `.env-example` to copy & paste the variables into your own `.env` file.

## Running the API

```bash
# development
$ npm run start

# watch mode
$ npm run start:dev

# production mode
$ npm run start:prod
